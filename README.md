learning piethon don't judge me 
just started teaching myself python and I really like it so far. Love learning more and more about software engineering and coding and I can't wait to see where it takes me. 
I was a Poly Sci and Communications major in college so this is very new to me and help would be appreciated. I'm not asking for someone to hold my hand but just tell me what 
resources to use and where to find good practice (i.e. quizzes and challenges). 

Thanks for checking out my bullshit page for a noob like me. Hopefully one day I can return the favor for someone and pay it forward.
